            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some doe take ‚Öî parts of Powder, ≈øome halfe, and others aboue ‚Öî parts; but that Peece mu≈øt bee well fortified that may, or will ≈øafely blow out ‚Öî parts of Powder of the weight of the Bullet. After you know the quantity of Powder, you mu≈øt put in the ≈øoule or concaue of the Peece the ≈øaid quantity, with the Ladle, and then when the Ladle comes to the Coyle, turne about your hand, and the Powder will be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, then pull out the Ladle, and turne the other ende, and ramm it in ≈øoftly, then wadd it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and la≈øt put in your Bullet, and wadd him likewi≈øe. But note that before you doe any of the≈øe things, you get the di≈øpart of the Peece, which is no more to doe then to put a wyre into the touch-hole of the Peece, to the lower part of the concaue, then marke how high the wyre beares vpon the quoile, which marked, pull him out, and place him at the mu≈ø≈øell to the bottome of the Concaue there, and make your Di≈øpart

<hi>Horizontall</hi> line, or line of Leuell; now for quicke di≈øpatch you may make cartreges of Paper, or Linnen baggs, and put a full Charge of Powder in them: So may you make a hole with a

               <p>Secondly, marke the numbers that belong vnto the la≈øt prick towards the left hand: Or whether he haue belonging vnto him one number or two, looke the roote of that number if it be ≈øquare, and that roote ≈øet by a crooked line, as you place the quotient in deui≈øion, and can≈øell all that ≈øquare number belonging to that prick.</p>
               <p>But if the number belonging to that prick bee not a ≈øquare number, then take the roote of the greate≈øt ≈øquare, which is contained in it, and place the roote as I ≈øaid before, and the ≈øquare of it ≈øhall you abate from the number which belong to the la≈øt &amp; prick, let the re≈øt be ≈øet ouer tho≈øe numbers cancelled, as you doe in deui≈øion, and ≈øo haue you ended that prick, then in the ≈øame manner goe forward with the re≈øt. As for example 200, you place your prickes fir≈øt on the cipher next your right hand, the next 2 the fir≈øt figure, then I aske what is the roote of 2, and I finde 1, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put that in my quotient, and ≈øub≈øtract it out of 2, and there remaines 1, then I double the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and it is 2 that I place ≈øtill betweene the two
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:174766:53"/> pricks, then I aske how many times 2 is in 10, and I finde 4 that I put al≈øo in my quotient, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtract it out of 10, then remaines 2, now I ≈øquare the la≈øt figure
4, ≈øaying 4 times 4 is 16, which I ≈øub≈øtract al≈øo out of 20, the remainder is 4, which is the true≈øt and ≈øpeedie≈øt way of all.</p>
               <p>Here I will produce ≈øome que≈øtions of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, which ≈øhall be to the purpo≈øe wee haue in hand, and al≈øo to ≈øhew and make manife≈øt vnto you, how nece≈ø≈øary it is for euery Souldier, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be Captaine, Lieutenant, or other Officer what≈øoeuer that followes the Warres, to haue good skill in the depth of Arithmetick, as in the extraction of rootes, and al≈øo in the Rule of <hi>Algebra.</hi>

15129.</p>
               <p>Now you mu≈øt ≈øearch out the ≈øquare roote by the former rules, ≈øo ≈øhall you haue the an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>2 A Prince hath an Army very great, with which he pa≈ø≈øeth in a valewe, ≈øo that in marching the Front can be but 18 men, and by that meanes the flanke containeth
